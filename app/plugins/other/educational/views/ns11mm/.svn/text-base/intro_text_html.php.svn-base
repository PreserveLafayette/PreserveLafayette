<div>
	The SimpleGallery plug-in generates online exhibitions from <a href="http://wiki.collectiveaccess.org/index.php?title=Sets" target="_blank">Sets</a> that you create.  By default, this page displays Sets of the type "exhibition."  To display Sets of another type, configure the type name next to simpleGallery_set_type in the simpleGallery.conf file in the simpleGallery plugin folder.  You can replace this text by editing the intro_text_html.php file in your theme folder in the SimpleGallery plugin directory.
