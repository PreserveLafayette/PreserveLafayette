		<i>The Isamu Noguchi Catalogue Raisonn&eacute;</i> is an ongoing project of The Isamu Noguchi Foundation and Garden Museum, New York, committed to documenting Isamu Noguchi's complete oeuvre. 
	</div>
	<div>
		The first chapter of this digital publication launched in 2011, comprising approximately one-tenth of the anticipated content of the catalogue. New chapters will be added to the website on an annual basis until research is complete. This progressive approach to publishing <i>The Isamu Noguchi Catalogue Raisonn&eacute;</i> allows for research on artworks, exhibitions, literature, and the chronology to continue while information presently known can be made available to the public for reference purposes.
	</div>
	<div>
		While research on <i>The Isamu Noguchi Catalogue Raisonn&eacute;</i> remains in progress, the following is offered to provide a better understanding of the project's objectives and the website's current status:
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Scope of Content</b><br/>
		When finalized, <i>The Isamu Noguchi Catalogue Raisonn&eacute;</i> is expected to feature up-to-date information on Isamu Noguchi’ s complete oeuvre. The final list of artworks will be inclusive of all categories of Noguchi's production, ranging from sculptures, drawings, and models to architectural spaces, stage sets, and manufactured designs. For more information, please review the project’s <?php print caNavLink($this->request, "Qualifications for Inclusion", "", "", "About", "Qualifications"); ?>. 
	</div>
	<div>
		The current content of this website exists in a working state. While research is ongoing, new artwork, exhibition, and bibliography entries will be added to this site on an annual basis, expanding current lists. 
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Publication Schedule</b><br/>
		Research on <i>The Isamu Noguchi Catalogue Raisonn&eacute;</i> is scheduled through 2018. Chapters of completed research will be added to this website on an annual basis. Information on forthcoming chapters will be provided at a later date.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Subject to Change</b><br/>
		While the project makes every effort to ensure that information provided on this website is fully accurate at the time of publication, the ongoing status of research necessitates that information in any area of the site is subject to change as new information emerges. Certain areas are more prone to change than others, such as exhibitions and bibliography as described below, and current collections as works change hands. Should significant new information emerge, more static areas may also be revised, such as titles, dates, or materials. When such changes occur, the nature of and reason for those revisions are noted and dated. Additionally, in rare instances, artworks, exhibitions, and bibliography entries currently on this site may be removed before <i>The Isamu Noguchi Catalogue Raisonn&eacute;</i> is completed should sufficient new information make those entries incongruous with the project’s stated <?php print caNavLink($this->request, "Qualifications for Inclusion", "", "", "About", "Qualifications"); ?>. For more information, please review the site’s <?php print caNavLink($this->request, "Terms and Conditions of Use", "", "", "About", "TermsConditions"); ?>.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Published Entries</b><br/>
		Artworks, exhibitions, and bibliography entries are considered fully “published” when research is finalized and presented in full on this website. For an artwork to have been published the work must have been examined and measured by project staff, its provenance and historical attributes fully updated, and publishable photography obtained. While project research remains ongoing, information provided on published entries remain subject to change as new research is completed. 
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Research Pending Entries</b><br/>
		Artworks, exhibitions, and bibliography entries for which research is currently ongoing or outstanding are also provided on this site to indicate anticipated content of <i>The Isamu Noguchi Catalogue Raisonn&eacute;</i>. These entries are given the status of “research pending,” with limited information provided, such as title, date, material, and photography (when available) for pending artworks. Once research is finalized, a research pending entry is updated with complete information and reclassified as “published.” Research pending entries are not considered part of <i>The Isamu Noguchi Catalogue Raisonné</i> until they have been reclassified as “published.”
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Search and Browsing</b><br/>
		Searching and browsing are limited to information currently available to the public. For example, the results from browsing exhibitions by curators will include only published exhibitions, as research-pending exhibitions do not contain information on curators.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Exhibitions and Publications</b><br/>
		A published artwork entry may include links to exhibitions in which it was included and literature in which it was cited. However, these lists are subject to change as new research on exhibitions and bibliography is finalized. Therefore, a published artwork entry's exhibition history and bibliography should not be interpreted as finalized at this time.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Chronology</b><br/>
		Although provided in a comprehensive state, research on the chronology remains ongoing. As with other areas of the site, the chronology is subject to change as new information emerges.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Images</b><br/>
		Every effort is made to provide one or more high-quality images for every artwork. Images presently available are the best or only available images of artworks and exhibitions. A gray box indicates the lack of any available image for a given artwork. As new images are obtained they will be added to the site on a semi-regular basis.
