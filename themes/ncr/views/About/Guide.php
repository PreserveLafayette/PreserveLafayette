	<div class="subheading">ARTWORKS</div>
	<div>
		<b>Order and Numbering System</b>
		<br/>Current artwork numbers are based on the catalogue numbers first assigned to objects in <i>The Sculpture of Isamu Noguchi, 1924–1979: A Catalogue</i> by Nancy Grove and Diane Botnick (Garland, 1980), originally 1–820, ordered chronologically. Artworks created after the publication of the Grove/Botnick catalogue are assigned a number above 820. Sculptures discovered after the publication of Grove/Botnick but dated prior to 1979 are generally incorporated into the chronological order by the assignment of an existing number with the addition the suffix “.01.,” “.02,” “.03,” etc. For example, no. 135 is a 1934 portrait included in Grove/Botnick, while no. 135.01, also a 1934 portrait, was discovered after the catalogue’s publication. 
	</div>
	<div>
		Artwork entries are generally ordered chronologically by the year the work was begun; within each year artworks may be ordered according to material, subject, or style. Exceptions to the ordering include drawings, models, and select sculptures that were not included in the Grove/Botnick catalogue, and that were catalogued en masse following Noguchi’s death. These works are assigned numbers between 2,000 and 9,000, irrespective of date. For example, drawings in the collection of The Isamu Noguchi Foundation inventoried in the 1990s were assigned sequential numbers beginning at 7,000. Additionally, artworks for which new date information has emerged since 1980 maintain their original number and place in the order. 
	</div>
	<div>
		Works that are directly related share a number followed by an alphabetical or numerical suffix, and are chronologically grouped together with the primary or earliest known example in the series. For example, no. 96A is assigned to a 1932 plaster, which was cast into two bronze editions in 1938, nos. 98B-1/2 and 98B-2/2. A, B, C, etc., often denote different versions in style or materials; fractions identify edition series numbers (i.e., 1 of 3); lowercase letters often denote a classification, such as “m” for models; numbers after a dash are assigned to relational elements of a whole. For example, while no. 139 is a complete dance set, nos. 139-1 and 139-2 are the two elements that make up that set.
	</div>
	<div>
		Once research is complete, new numbers will be added to artwork included in <i>The Isamu Noguchi Catalogue Raisonn&eacute;</i> to supersede the current numbers, which will remain accessible for reference purposes. The new numbers will serve to reincorporate all works into a chronological order.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Photography</b>
		<br/><i>The Isamu Noguchi Catalogue Raisonn&eacute;</i> aims to provide high-quality photographs of all artworks for reference purposes, including all available contemporary primary and alternative views, historic photographs, and situational photography from studio and exhibition records. Extant photographs of exhibitions are also provided with corresponding exhibition entries.
	</div>
	<div>
		While every effort is made to obtain high-quality photography of each artwork, low-quality photographs may be provided if they are the only available. If no photograph is presently available for a given artwork, this is indicated by a gray box in place of an image. As new images are obtained they will be added to the site on a semi-regular basis. Artworks that have been made in multiples, including cast or constructed editions, for which photography is unavailable, may be displayed with a representative photograph of another “identical” example from that series with the substitution noted until separate photography is acquired.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Titles</b>
		<br/>Titles are presented as assigned by Noguchi and/or as published in Grove/Botnick, including primary and secondary titles. If no formal title was assigned or published in Grove/Botnick, artwork titles provided here reflect the most recent exhibition checklist and/or publication. If no evidence of an assigned title is available, works are left untitled, or given a descriptive name if necessary to distinguish the work or identify it with a series. For example, models for larger projects or realized sculptures, which were rarely assigned titles, are titled as the finished work. Historical titles assigned by Noguchi at one time and later changed by the artist are noted in the comments section. Additionally, title errors that appear in Grove/Botnick, such as misspelled names of portrait sitters, have been corrected rather than maintained. 
	</div>
	<div>
		Although Noguchi primarily titled his artworks in English, some foreign-language titles are included, most commonly among the ceramics, for which he often assigned a secondary Japanese title in rômaji. Translations for foreign-language titles are provided in parentheses if the translation varies significantly from the English title of the work.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Dates</b>
		<br/>Dates are given by year or years for each artwork from the point the work was begun or presumed to have begun, and completed or presumed to have been completed. When an artwork was begun and completed within one year, that year is given. When an artwork was begun one year and completed another year, the range of years is given. When an artwork is thought to have been completed within one year, with no certain evidence, that year is preceded by “circa,” abbreviated as “c.” When an artwork is thought to have been completed in one year or another, with no certain evidence, a range of years is given preceded by “c.”
	</div>
	<div>
		Many editioned artworks have previously been dated as the original or prototype. In this publication, they are dated by the year cast or constructed for each individual edition (but grouped chronologically with the earliest known example). For example, whereas a 1963 cast of a 1944 sculpture has appeared elsewhere dated 1944 or 1944–63, here it is dated 1963. Additionally, as Noguchi often spread an edition run over several decades, and historical accounts of fabrications are frequently incomplete, many casts are given circa dates.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Materials</b>
		<br/>All materials involved in the composition of an artwork are generally listed in descending order from the primary material. Material type is provided to the highest level of specificity determinable. However, in some cases, this is limited by the inability to attain geological surveys or other laboratory work. Materials in these cases are listed in broader terms.
	</div>
	<div>
		In the case of some marbles, granites, clays, and glazes, the material’s regional source is given to further specify the material type. Often, this is as specified by Noguchi; deference is given to the artist's description of material over formal geological terms, occasionally extending to the inclusion of unconfirmed or unknown regional descriptions or materials.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Dimensions</b>
		<br/>Dimensions appear in inches, followed by centimeter equivalents in order of height, width, and depth. Measurements are taken in inches, generally to the closest 1/8 of an inch (occasionally to within 1/16 of an inch for very small works, or 1/2 of an inch for very large works). Width is determined by establishing either the front of the sculpture or the widest point; depth is taken at 90 degrees from the established width. Diameters are given in two measurements. For example, a vertical cylinder with a diameter of 8 inches and a height of 3 inches would appear as 3 x 8 x 8 in.
	</div>
	<div>
		Measurements are given for the overall size of the artwork as assembled and installed, inclusive of all attached elements. For artworks with separate relational elements, dimensions are given for each element in the composition. Measurements for bases are given separately, and not included in the overall size of the artwork.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Bases and Supports</b>
		<br/>A base is identified as a detachable structure used for the artwork’s display and presentation and that is essential to the presentation of the artwork but is not an integral part of the artwork’s composition or essential to the original concept of the work. Integral and essential supports are defined as "elements" of the artwork.
	</div>
	<div>
		Materials and dimensions of bases are provided. Bases cited are limited to those that were constructed, commissioned, or chosen by Noguchi. Pedestals, frames, mats, and other interchangeable means of presentation and support are generally not included.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Inscriptions</b>
		<br/>Noguchi signed his name in a variety of styles, which evolved, changed, and overlapped during his career. How and where an inscription or signature appears on an artwork is relayed through a combination of text and symbols. Foundry marks or other tags related to the artwork's construction or history may also be noted. If no signature or inscription exists on the artwork, "not inscribed" is indicated. In the rare case that the examination of the artwork cannot determine the presence or lack of a signature due to the work's installation or state, "unconfirmed" is indicated.
	</div>
	<div>
		Signatures and inscriptions are described with the relative location on the work. Artworks for which a proper "front" is not established may note an inscription on the work's "back" or otherwise. In these cases, the location is reflective of how the artwork was measured, and is not intended to define a formal orientation for the work.
	</div>
	<div>
		Occasionally, dates and edition numbers inscribed on the work may not match information provided elsewhere in the entry for an artwork. Several incidents have been found where the information inscribed is known to be incorrect; for example, in one edition run of 6, two bronzes are inscribed 4/6, and none 6/6. Information may be provided in the comments section to elaborate on these inconsistencies as they appear.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Edition</b>
		<br/>An artwork’s place within a larger series of related works is noted, including editions (copies) and versions (minor variations on a theme). Version series include multiple renderings of the same form created manually (i.e., not cast), as in two portraits created of the same sitter. Edition series often include an original artwork, from which a cast was made; copies cast through a mold process, most often in bronze, terra-cotta, or plaster; artist’s proofs (APs), working proofs (WPs), and artist’s copies (ACs) made before, during, or after the casting process; and derivative copies of an original not made through the process of casting, but rather via manual construction. Occasionally, there exists no evidence of an original version from which casts were created having been maintained by the artist; the original is therefore considered “discarded” and not noted in the edition series nor included in the catalogue.  
	</div>
	<div>
		When an edition number has been assigned to an artwork by Noguchi and/or the work’s fabricator, this is indicated (i.e. “number 7 from an edition of 8”); when no number has been assigned, only the size of the series may be indicated (i.e. “1 of 2 from an unnumbered edition”). Occasionally, edition numbers inscribed on an artwork are known to be incorrect; for example, in one edition run of 6, two bronzes are inscribed 4/6, and none 6/6. Therefore one of the examples inscribed 4/6 is described as example 6 of 6 casts. Information may be provided in the comments section to elaborate on these inconsistencies as they appear.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Fabricators and Collaborators</b>
		<br/>Individuals or groups involved with Noguchi in the creation of an artwork may be credited with their role, including foundries for cast sculptures, manufacturers for design works, partnering architects, and commissioners for projects. As Noguchi often worked with many individuals and companies in the creation of sculptures, designs, and projects, the inclusion of collaborators is generally limited to the categories above, and may not include staff members of Noguchi’s studios, consultants, funding individuals or organizations, etc.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Descriptions and Comments</b>
		Descriptions may be provided to elaborate on the qualities and state of the artwork, such as “unrealized model.” Comments may be provided to elaborate on historical or other significant attributes of the artwork that have not been provided in other fields. Descriptions and comments are not interpretive, but rather limited to factual and contextual information.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Current Collection and Provenance</b>
		<br/>The most comprehensive and accurate version of an artwork’s current ownership and provenance at the time of publication is provided and may include the year and method of acquisition if known. Information provided on current and past ownership is highly selective; unknown or unconfirmed information is identified by a question mark in brackets, or left out entirely.
	</div>
	<div>
		Collection credits and provenance notations are provided as stipulated by the artwork's current and past owners at the time of publication. Individual collectors who have indicated their desire to be unnamed are listed as “Private Collection.”  Collectors who have not indicated a preferred credit are listed as “Anonymous.” Artworks that have been determined as lost or destroyed are listed as such in place of ownership. Works for which no current location has been determined at the end of the project’s research will be published with "Whereabouts Unknown" listed in place of ownership. 
	</div>
	<div>
		Provenance is listed from the first known owner to the current collection. Whereas Noguchi was generally the first owner of each artwork, the artist is not listed in the provenance unless the work was reobtained from an outside owner prior to the establishment of The Isamu Noguchi Foundation in 1980. Artworks in Noguchi’s possession that had not been transferred to The Isamu Noguchi Foundation at the time of the artist’s death in 1988 include the Estate of the Artist in the provenance. Auctions and galleries, while seldom owners of a work per se, are generally included in the provenance in order to distinguish artworks that consistently remain in unidentified private collections. If a work was in the possession of a collection that changed names during ownership, separate entries are given for each name. For example, works acquired by The Isamu Noguchi Foundation (INF), and currently in the same collection, now known as The Isamu Noguchi Foundation and Garden Museum (INFGM, as of 2004), include the INF in the provenance, while citing separately the INFGM as the current collection. 
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Exhibitions</b>
		<br/>The list of exhibitions for an artwork entry includes solo and group exhibitions in which the work was featured, ordered chronologically from oldest to newest, with a focus on a comprehensive list through 1988 and a selective list following  Noguchi’s death. An artwork is considered “exhibited” if it was included in any part of a traveling exhibition. 
	</div>
	<div>
		An exhibition that included an artwork that is part of an edition series is listed only with the example that was shown, rather than with each work from the series. For example, if cast number 1 from an edition of 3 was exhibited, that exhibition appears only with the entry for 1/3, and not with the entries for 2/3 and 3/3. 
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Bibliography</b>
		<br/>The bibliography for an artwork entry includes books, essays, newspaper and journal articles, exhibition catalogues, monographs, and other writings in which the work was cited and/or illustrated. Page numbers, catalogue numbers, and illustration numbers are also noted. Focus is placed on a comprehensive bibliography through 1988, with a selective list following Noguchi’s death. 
	</div>
	<div>
		Literature that cites or depicts an artwork that is part of an edition series is listed only with the example cited or illustrated, rather than with each example from the series. For example, if cast number 1 from an edition of 3 was cited, that publication appears only with the entry for 1/3, and not with the entries for 2/3 and 3/3.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Associated Artworks</b>
		<br/>Artworks that are directly related are linked in either “parent-child” or “see also” style relationships. Parent-child relationships include the relationship of an original artwork to its casts or subsequent versions; realized projects or sculptures to preparatory models or sketches; and environments composed of multiple relational artworks to those elements. See also relationships include, for example, the relationship of an artwork with a particular style or theme to a work with a similar style or theme, or one cast from a series to another cast from the same series. 
	</div>
	<div class="subheading">EXHIBITIONS</div>
	<div>
		Exhibition entries are ordered chronologically from the oldest to the newest, and are inclusive of both solo and group exhibitions in which artworks included in <i>The Isamu Noguchi Catalogue Raisonn&eacute;</i> were shown. Title, venue, and dates, including travel venues are provided. The checklist of artworks is based on historical checklists, and/or when none is available, research on extant correspondence and photography. Uncertainties are noted in the comments section.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Venues and Dates</b>
		<br/>For exhibitions that have traveled to multiple venues, the first or organizing institution is listed as the primary venue. The date provided reflects the date of the first instance of the exhibition being shown. Additional venues and dates are provided below. While exact checklists of artworks may change from venue to venue, the artworks listed encompass all known works shown over the duration of the exhibition.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Editioned Artworks</b>
		<br/>While every effort is made to ensure exact checklists, in the case of artworks with multiple versions or editions, it may be impossible to identify which version or edition was shown in the exhibition. In these cases, the “first” example in the series is included in the checklist of artworks, with notations made in the comments section. For example, if one cast from an edition of 3 is known to have been exhibited with no evidence of the exact example shown, version 1/3 is cited by default.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Catalogues</b>
		<br/>The publication of an exhibition catalogue is indicated by a link to the corresponding bibliography citation. Generally, pamphlets and promotional materials are not noted.
	</div>
	<div class="subheading">BIBLIOGRAPHY</div>
		<div>
			Bibliography entries are ordered chronologically from the oldest to the newest, and are inclusive of writings both by and about Isamu Noguchi. All information relevant to the publication (or unpublished document) is noted, including but not limited to author(s), editor(s), translator(s), title, year and/or date, journal, series, publisher, and place of publication. Page number of articles or specified sections of books are provided whenever determinable. 
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Citation</b>
		<br/>Bibliographic citations are styled following the Chicago Manual of Style according to the format of the writing (book, magazine article, newspaper article, transcript, etc.).
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Artworks Cited</b>
		<br/>Artworks included in <i>The Isamu Noguchi Catalogue Raisonn&eacute;</i> that were cited in the entry and/or illustrated are listed, with corresponding page numbers, figure numbers, and illustration page numbers in parentheses. 
	</div>
	<div>
		While every effort is made to ensure exact lists of citations, in the case of artworks with multiple versions or editions, it may be impossible to identify which version or edition was cited or illustrated. In these cases, the “first” example in the series is included in the list of citations, with notations made in the comments section For example, if one cast from an edition of 3 is cited or illustrated with no evidence of the exact example included, version 1/3 is listed by default.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Contributing Authors</b>
		<br/>Contributing authors not noted in the citation are listed with their role, such as “essay by,” or “foreword by.” 
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Exhibition Catalogues</b>
		<br/>Texts written specifically for exhibitions included in <i>The Isamu Noguchi Catalogue Raisonn&eacute;</i> are linked to their corresponding exhibitions.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Languages</b>
		<br/>The language of non-English or multi-language texts is noted. Generally, the titles of texts not written in the ISO basic Latin alphabet are translated, with that change noted in the comments section.
