		<b>Order and Numbering system</b><br/>
		Artwork numbers are based on the IDs first assigned to objects in The Sculpture of Isamu Noguchi, 1924-1979: A Catalogue by Nancy Grove and Diane Botnick (Garland: 1980), originally 1-820 ordered chronologically. Once research is complete, new numbers will be added to supersede the current numbers, which will remain accessible for reference purposes.
	</div>
	<div>
		Artwork entries are generally numbered chronologically by the year the work was begun; within each year artworks may be ordered according to material, subject, or style. Artworks that are directly related are grouped together by a shared number followed by an alpha or numeric suffix. For example, a sculpture may be grouped with related editions, versions, or studies; designs for the stage with individual elements; projects with models. 
	</div>
	<div>
		Exceptions to the ordering include drawings, models, and select sculptures, which are assigned numbers between 2000 and 9000 irrespective of date. Artworks for which new date information has emerged since 1980 maintain their original number. These entries will be reordered within the final number system once complete. 
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Photography</b><br/>
		While every effort is made to obtain high-quality photography of each artwork included in the <i>Isamu Noguchi Catalogue Raisonn&eacute;</i>, images presently included are the best or only available. Priority is given to the most recent image, but should vintage photographs of the work's original state exist, those are also included. For many sculptures, alternate views are provided. Artworks that have been made in multiples, including cast or constructed editions, may be illustrated with a single photograph representative of the edition series.
	</div>
	<div>
		If no photograph is presently available for a given artwork, this is indicated by a gray box in place of an image. As new images are obtained they will be added to the site on a semi-regular basis.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Titles</b><br/>
		Titles are presented as assigned by the artist, occasionally including secondary or tertiary titles. If no formal title was assigned, artworks are titled as in other publications, left untitled, or given a descriptive name, such as with a series of drawings. Models for larger projects or realized sculptures were rarely assigned titles; these are titled here as the finished work, with additional information provided under the description. Historical titles assigned by Noguchi at one time and later changed by the artist are noted in the comments section.
	</div>
	<div>
		Although Noguchi primarily titled his artworks in English, some foreign language titles are included, most commonly for the ceramics, which he often assigned a secondary Japanese title in Romanji. Translations for foreign language titles are provided in parenthesis if the translation varies significantly from the English title of the work.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Dates</b><br/>
		Dates are given by year or years for each artwork from the point the work was begun or presumed begun, and completed or presumed completed. When an artwork was begun and completed within one year, that year is given. When an artwork was begun one year and completed another year, the range of years is given. When an artwork is thought to have been completed within one year, with no certain evidence, that year is preceded by a circa symbol. When an artwork is thought to have been completed in one year or another, with no certain evidence, a range of years is given preceded by a circa symbol.
	</div>
	<div>
		Many editioned artworks have previously been dated as the original or prototype. In this publication, they are dated by the year cast or constructed for each individual edition (but grouped chronologically with the earliest known example). As Noguchi often spread an edition run over several decades, and historical accounts of fabrications are frequently incomplete, many of these entries are given circa dates. 
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Material and Technique</b><br/>
		All materials involved in the composition of an artwork are generally listed in descending order from the primary material. Material type is provided to the highest level of specificity determinable. However, in some cases, this is limited by the inability to attain geological surveys or other laboratory work. Materials in these cases are listed in broader terms.
	</div>
	<div>
		In the case of some marbles, granites, clays, and glazes, the material's regional source is given to further specify the material type. Often, this is as specified by Noguchi; deference is given to the artist's description of material over formal geological terms. 
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Dimensions</b><br/>
		Dimensions appear in inches, followed by centimeter equivalents in order of height, width, depth. Measurements are generally taken to the closest 1/8 of an inch (occasionally to within 1/16 of an inch for very small work, or 1/2 of an inch for very large works). Width is determined by establishing either the front of the sculpture or the widest point; depth is taken at 90 degrees from the established width. When a diameter is measured, the measurement is provided as the same value for the two dimensions which the diameter represents.
	</div>
	<div>
		Measurements are given for the overall size of the artwork as assembled and installed, inclusive of all attached elements. For artworks with separate relational elements, dimensions are given for each element in the composition. Measurements for bases are given separately, and not included in the overall size of the artwork.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Bases and Supports</b><br/>
		Materials and dimensions of bases are provided. A base is identified as a detachable structure used for the artwork's display and presentation, which is essential to the presentation of the artwork but is not an integral part of the artwork's composition or essential to the original concept of the work. Integral and essential supports are defined as "elements" of the artwork. 
	</div>
	<div>
		Bases cited are generally limited to those which were constructed, commissioned, or chosen by Noguchi. Pedestals, frames, mats, and other interchangeable means of presentation and support are generally not included.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Inscriptions</b><br/>
		Noguchi signed his name in a variety of styles, which evolved, changed, and overlapped during his career. How and where the inscription appears is relayed through by a combination of text and symbols, where necessary. Foundry marks or other tags related to the artwork's construction or history may also be noted. If no signature or inscription exists on the artwork, "not inscribed" is indicated. In the rare case that the examination of the artwork cannot determine the presence or lack of a signature due to the work's installation or state, "unconfirmed" is indicated. 
	</div>
	<div>
		Signatures and inscriptions are described with the relative location on the work. Artworks for which a proper "front" is not established may note an inscription on the work's "back" or otherwise. In these cases, the location is reflective of how the artwork was measured, and is not intended to define a formal directional for the work. 
	</div>
	<div>
		Occasionally, dates and edition numbers inscribed on the work may not match information provided elsewhere on the artwork's page. Several incidents have been found where the information inscribed is known to be incorrect; for example, in one edition run of 6, two bronzes are inscribed 4/6, and none 6/6. Information may be provided in the comments section to elaborate on these inconsistencies as they appear.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Fabricators and Collaborators</b><br/>
		Individuals or groups involved with Noguchi in the creation of the artwork may be credited with their role. This may include fabricators for sculptures, manufacturers for design works, architects for projects, and choreographers for dance works.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Descriptions and Comments</b><br/>
		Descriptions may be provided to elaborate on the qualities and state of the artwork. Comments may be provided to elaborate on historical or other significant attributes of the artwork that have not been provided in other fields. Descriptions and comments are not interpretive, but rather limited to factual and contextual information.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Current Collection and Provenance</b><br/>
		A collection credit is provided as stipulated by the artwork's owner. In lieu of a specified credit line from private collections, an anonymous credit is listed by default. Works that have been determined as lost or destroyed are listed as such in place of ownership. Works with unknown ownership that have not been determined as lost or destroyed are listed as "whereabouts unknown" in place of ownership.
	</div>
	<div>
		Where available and confirmed, provenance is listed from oldest to newest, and may include the collection, years of ownership, and method of acquisition. Auctions are generally included in order to distinguish artworks that consistently remain in anonymous private collections. Information given on provenance is highly selective; unknown or unconfirmed information is indicated wherever possible.
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Exhibitions</b><br/>
		The list of exhibitions paired with an artwork entry includes solo and group exhibitions in which the work was featured, with a focus on a comprehensive list through 1988, and a selective list following the artist's death. While every effort is made to ensure exact checklists, in the case of artworks with multiple versions or editions, it may not be possible to identify which version or edition was shown in the exhibition. In these cases, the first example in the series is included and noted as default.
	</div>
	<div>
		The complete checklist and additional information on a given exhibition can be found on that exhibition's page. 
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Bibliography</b><br/>
		The bibliography paired with an artwork entry includes books, essays, newspaper and journal articles, exhibition catalogues, monographs, and other writings in which the work was cited and/or illustrated. Focus is placed on a comprehensive bibliography through 1988, with a selective list following the artist's death. While every effort is made to ensure exact citations, in the case of artworks with multiple versions or editions, it may not be possible to identify which version or edition was referenced in the publication. In these cases, the first example in the series is cited and noted as default.
