		<i>The Isamu Noguchi Catalogue Raisonn&eacute;</i> has evolved from over three decades of research and documentation of Isamu Noguchi's life and work. Numerous projects to inventory and account for the artist's corpus have been organized beginning at Noguchi's studio, followed by the Isamu Noguchi Foundation, and finally The Isamu Noguchi Foundation and Garden Museum. These studies have resulted in a wealth of information upon which the project builds.

		The first formal account of Noguchi's life and work began with the compilation and publication of <i>The Sculpture of Isamu Noguchi, 1924–1979: A Catalogue</i> (Garland, 1980) by Nancy Grove and Diane Botnick. At the time it was published, <i>The Sculpture of Isamu Noguchi</i> was a thorough account of Noguchi's sculpture, but it did not account for other categories of work, such as drawings, and was quickly outdated as the artist continued to create artwork over the next decade. With these disparities in mind, a program to inventory new and undocumented artworks was initiated by Noguchi's studio staff members in the 1980s.

		After Noguchi's death in 1988, inventory efforts continued alongside new projects to document Noguchi's studios. The appraisal of the artist’s estate in the early 1990s led to the discovery of previously unrecorded artworks. The processing of Noguchi's archives was also begun, making a wealth of historical documents and photographs accessible. These important resources are the project's primary assets.

		In the early 1990s, the plan to create a comprehensive catalogue raisonné from The Isamu Noguchi Foundation's growing studio and estate inventories was formalized. The catalogue project developed throughout the decade, with a new concentration on recording artworks outside of the Foundation's collection. In 1999, the catalogue raisonné project gained its first editor and formalized its current methodology. Early plans for print publication were discarded in favor of an online publication to improve accessibility and accelerate the project's schedule. A chronological structure was adopted in place of subdivided bodies of work. Research began in earnest with a focus on Noguchi's dance sets for Martha Graham.

		In 2004, the project slowed in momentum as it underwent a process of review. Reinitiated with a new plan of work in 2008, <i>The Isamu Noguchi Catalogue Raisonn&eacute;</i> project is again actively underway. The first chapter of the digital <i>Isamu Noguchi Catalogue Raisonné</i> was launched in 2011 with completed research on select artworks, exhibitions, bibliography, and chronology. Continued research and annual publication is ongoing.
