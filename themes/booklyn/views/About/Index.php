	<p>Booklyn's mission is to promote artist books as an art form and an educational resource. In addition to assisting artists in exhibiting, distributing, and publishing artist books, we provide the general public and educational institutions with services and programming centered around contemporary artists books.</p>

	<p>Booklynâ€™s collection is THE source for unique and limited edition contemporary artist's books and works on paper. Booklyn favors fresh, original writing and art and welcomes new media and innovative techniques. We believe content and form are inextricable from one another, but content must be the driving force. We act on behalf of living artists and rarely stray from contemporary work.</p>

	<p>Booklyn places the work of emerging artists on the same table as McArthur Genius Grant winners, and places $5 zines next to $15,000 unique books. By distributing, exhibiting, and publishing these works together, Booklyn presents marginalized voices in a context often reserved for more established artists. </p>
