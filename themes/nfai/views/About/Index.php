<h1>About the Project</h1>
<div class="textContent">
	<p>The National Folklore Archives Initiative (NFAI) is an American
Folklore Society-managed effort to document and provide access to
information about folklore archival collections held by folklore
programs at academic institutions, community-based cultural and ethnic
organizations, non-profit organizations, and state government-based
arts and cultural agencies in the United States.</p>

<p>The NFAI is made possible by generous support from the Humanities
Collections and Reference Resources program of the <a href="http://www.neh.gov/grants/preservation/humanities-collections-and-reference-resources" target="_blank">Division of
Preservation and Access of the National Endowment for the Humanities
</a>.
</p>

<p>Folklore archival collections—unpublished multi-format collections of
materials created in the field that document traditional cultural
expressions and knowledge—comprise one of our nation’s most valuable
cultural resources, but scholars, public humanists, teachers,
students, and community members can access these materials only with
difficulty. These collections exist in a wide variety of institutions.
Many of them are not formal archives or libraries, and lack the means
to build and maintain an infrastructure to coordinate this work.</p>

<p>To begin to address these issues, NFAI has developed this open-access
Web-based database, which provides information about folklore archival
repositories and collections across the United States. It includes a
cataloging template based on national descriptive standards that is
designed for the needs of multi-format folklore archival collections.</p>

<p>Archivists at 12 test sites are now testing this cataloging tool by
entering information about their collections:</p>

<p>In addition, the NFAI project team is carrying out a national survey
to gather basic data about the folklore archival collections, many of
them “hidden,” of a universe of several hundred folklore programs at
academic institutions, community-based cultural and ethnic
organizations, non-profit organizations, and state government-based
cultural agencies across the US. We will include this information in
the database as a first step toward improving the discoverability and
preservation of these collections.</p>

<p>Future plans for the NFAI project include:</p>
* Engaging and training more repositories to use the tool<br/>
* Creating long-term scalable solutions for user training<br/>
* Automating the ingest of existing archival records<br/>
* Completing of the development of an organizational infrastructure to<br/>
manage, govern, support, and sustain the NFAI for the long term<br/></p>
